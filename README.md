# Welcome to the Inventory program!

## About the program
This is a Python program that reads from the inventory.txt file and allows stock management for a fictional shoe shop.

The user can view all shoes in stock, enter a new pair, search for a specific one, restock, calculate the total value for each pair in stock, and display special message for the pair with the highest quantity in stock. 

## Usage section
You can navigate through the menu and select the option you would like to try!
Please note this program runs in the console.
